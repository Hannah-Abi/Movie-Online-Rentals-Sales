## Step-by-step of analyzing 
### Step 1: Install SQL in Jupyter NoteBook
SQL is a powerful language for working with relational databases, and many data scientists work with SQL on a regular basis. By using SQL in Jupyter Notebook, you can:
- Query and manipulate data directly within your notebook environment
- Combine SQL queries with Python code to create more complex analyses and visualizations
- Easily share your SQL queries and results with others by exporting your notebook as a PDF or HTML file
#### There are 2 main ways to run SQL query in JP: 
- Using pandasql Queries (check file [EDA-in-SQL](./EDA-in-SQL.ipynb)
- Using ```ipython-sql``` to install SQL kernal 
### Step 2:  Run the following file in order:
1.  [EDA-in-SQL.ipynb](./EDA-in-SQL.ipynb): using simple SQL queries to extract and aggregated data from its database.
- KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) aid companies in defining and monitoring success.
- Revenue, calculated as the sum of prices for rented movies, is a key indicator for MovieNow```s success.
- In customer relations management, ```customer satisfaction``` is quantified by the average movie rating.
- ```Customer engagement``` is measured by the number of active customers within a specific timeframe.
- The course teaches how to define KPIs, extract data, and monitor it over time for informed decision-making.
